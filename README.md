# OctoPrint-Lathe

This plugin will provide simple Lathe CAM.  It is loosely based on the feature building block concept used by [Denford](http://www.denfordata.com/)'s [Lathe CAM Designer](http://www.denfordata.com/pdfs/lathecam.pdf), an educational / "easy to use" Lathe CAM package from the late '90s.

As a design decision, OctoPrint-Lathe does not support feature/block attributes like chamfers and fillets.  These "attributes" should instead be their own features/blocks.  Tapered features make good chamfers and concave/convex features make good fillets.

## Setup

### Eventually
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
